We respect and value the privacy of everyone who visits this website, www.sincebrexit.co.uk (“Our Site”) and as described in Parts 5 and 6, below, we do not collect personal data about you unless you contact us. Any personal data we do collect will only be used as permitted by law.

      Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and ensure that you understand it. Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy is deemed to occur upon your first use of Our Site. If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using Our Site immediately.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><span class="li-title">Information About Us</span><br>
          Our Site is owned and operated by Paul Coffey, a private person as a proof of concept and has no legal register.
        </li>
        <li><span class="li-title">What Does This Policy Cover?</span><br>
          This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of Our Site. Our Site may contain links to other websites. Please note that we have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.
        </li>
        <li><span class="li-title">What is Personal Data?</span><br>
          Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’. <br>

          Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.
        </li>
        <li><span class="li-title">What Are My Rights?</span><br>
          Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold: <br>
          <ol>
            <li>The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 10.</li>
            <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 9 will tell you how to do this.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 10 to find out more.</li>
            <li>The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we have. Please contact us using the details in Part 10 to find out more.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.</li>
            <li>The right to withdraw consent. This means that, if we are relying on your consent as the legal basis for using your personal data, you are free to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
            <li>The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us or a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.</li>
            <li>Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your personal data in this way.</li>
            <br>
            For more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in Part 10. <br>

            Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau. <br>

            If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office. <br>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="li-title">What Personal Data Do You Collect?</span><br>
          Subject to the following, we do not collect any personal data from you. We do not place cookies on your computer or device, nor do we use any other means of data collection. <br>

        </li>
        <li><span class="li-title">How Do You Use My Personal Data?</span><br>
          If we do collect any personal data, it will be processed and stored securely, for no longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. We will comply with our obligations and safeguard your rights under the GDPR at all times. For more details on security see Part 7, below. <br>

          As stated above, we do not generally collect any personal data. If you contact us and we obtain your personal details from your email, we may use them to respond to your email. <br>

        <li><span class="li-title">How and Where Do You Store My Data?</span><br>
          We will only store your personal data within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This means that your personal data will be fully protected under the GDPR or to equivalent standards by law.

        </li>
        <li><span class="li-title">How Can I Access My Personal Data?</span><br>
          We don't store any personal data.
